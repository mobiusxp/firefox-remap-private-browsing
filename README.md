# Remap Private Browsing Hotkey to Ctrl + Shift + N
Make it so that when you want to open Private Browsing on Firefox, you can use Ctrl + Shift + N like you do on other browsers. 

## Why did I make this?
As someone who uses mutliple browsers (Safari on MacOS, Chrome / Firefox at work, Edge / Firefox / Brave on my personal Windows), I wanted to consolidate and support Firefox because Microsoft Edge keeps changing my settings and shoving stuff I don't want into my face. The only problem is I keep hitting Ctrl + Shift + N when I want to shop for gifts for family and friends and it gets annoying on Firefox. Fortunately, UserChrome is a thing on Firefox (and another reason why they're so great). Anyways here's a script so that you can standardize the private browsing button. 

Credit goes to https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/g1w6og/any_way_to_create_personalized_keyboard_shortcuts/fno20tf/ for the example script.
